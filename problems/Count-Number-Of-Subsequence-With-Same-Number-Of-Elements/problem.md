# Count Number Of Subsequence With Same Number Of Elements

&nbsp;

#### Given an array arr[] consisting of N integers, the task is to find the total number of subsequence which contain only one distinct number repeated throughout the subsequence.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```

**Example 2:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]
```

&nbsp;

18
```

&nbsp;
**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 3, 4, 9, 1, 3]
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
16
```

&nbsp;
