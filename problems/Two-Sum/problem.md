# Two Sum

&nbsp;

#### Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

#### You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#### Return ans in increasing order.

&nbsp;

**Example 1:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [2, 7, 11, 15] target = 9
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
[0, 1]
```

&nbsp;

**Example 2:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [3, 2, 4] target = 6
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
[1, 2]
```

&nbsp;
**Example 3:**

&nbsp;

**Input**

```
arr = [3, 3] target = 6
```

&nbsp;

**Output**

```
[0, 1]
```

&nbsp;

### Constraints

&nbsp;

- 1 <= arr.length <= 10^5

  &nbsp;

- -10^9 <= arr[i]= 10^9

  &nbsp;

- -10^9 <= target <= 10^9
